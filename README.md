# real-time-standardization
A script that calculates the z-score of the streaming data. 

# Description
This script uses an algorithm which calculates the mean, variance and z-score of the streaming data. In this script z-score is calculated in both batch and real-time(streaming) techniques(algorith), and compare the result of each technique in order to prove that real-time(streaming) standardization(z-score) is working without any error or loss.
